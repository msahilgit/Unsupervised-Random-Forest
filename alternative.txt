The URF module can be easily used without requiring installation, as it does not necessitates specific dependencies and versions.

For the above, use URF as follows:

step-1: <br>
&emsp; the files model.py, cluster.py, and metrics.py import some in-folder dependencies, as ```from . import utils``` <br>
&emsp; change these lines to simple import statements, as ```import utils``` (just by removing ```from . ```) <br>

step-2: <br>
&emsp; put the URF path in the python script or notebook. <br>
```
import sys
sys.path.append('./URF')
from model import unsupervised_random_forest as urf
```
