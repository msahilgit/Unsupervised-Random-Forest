# Unsupervised-Random-Forest
Though, supervised versions of Random Forest is common in machine learning, unsupervised Random Forest (urf) is rarely used and not even implemented in python libraries. Here, we provide unsupervised version of random forest and how it is of critical importance to understanding of protein functions.
