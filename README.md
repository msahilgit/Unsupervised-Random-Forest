# Unbiased learning of protein's conformational representation via unsupervised random forest

Accurate data representation is essential for extracting meaningful insights from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, particularly for rare events. Traditional approaches for identifying functionally relevant protein motions, such as principal component analysis (PCA), time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) or autoencoder based latent representation, focus on dimensionality reduction, which may not neccesarily yield noise free representation. Feature selection methods, on the other hand, aim to exclusively capture the most relevant degrees of freedom but often rely on supervised techniques requiring labeled data, limiting their utility for novel systems.

In this work, we introduce a completely self-supervised and self-guided version of random forest referred hereby as unsupervised random forest (URF) approach for feature selection in MD simulations. URF identifies the most informative features without prior knowledge of the rare states. This makes it ideal for exploring unknown systems and capturing functionally relevant protein motions, as explicitly checked for 10 different protein systems ranging from globular folded to intrinsically disordered proteins. Importantly, the hyperparameters for multi-step URF protocol can be internally selected by a novel metric, learning coefficient. We benchmarked the URF protocol against existing approaches like spectral oasis, saliency, deepTICA, MoSAIC, AMINO and others, where URF has consistently performed better or at par. URF can identify functional regions of proteins at par or better than Diffnet, current state of the art ML protocol. URF selected representation facilitate downstream analysis like markov model building and outperforming vampnet models. We proposed a user-friendly and memory efficient python implementation of URF, marking its first usage in protein biophysics.
